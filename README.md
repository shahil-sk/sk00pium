# sk00pium ðŸ¥·

- sk â€“ What people call me ðŸ˜Ž
- 00pium â€“ Inspired by a record label I like ðŸŽµ

sk00pium is my personal Linux distro, built from scratch with minimal functionality

because I always wanted to create my own OS!
In the next update I will be adding internet functionalities and gcc libraries.....


Huge thanks to Maple Circuit for the detailed guide on Linux libraries, compilers, and system structure! This project is a testament to that learning journey.
