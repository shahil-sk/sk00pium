# sk00pium 🥷

🔹 sk – What people call me 😎
🔹 00pium – Inspired by a record label I like 🎵

sk00pium is my personal Linux distro, built from scratch with minimal functionality—because I always wanted to create my own OS!
In the next update I will be adding internet functionalities and gcc libraries.....


Huge thanks to Maple Circuit for the detailed guide on Linux libraries, compilers, and system structure! This project is a testament to that learning journey.
